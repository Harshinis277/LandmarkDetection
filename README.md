#LandmarkDetection
This project focuses on developing a deep learning model for landmark detection in images. Landmark detection involves identifying and localizing specific points of interest in images, such as famous landmarks, buildings, or natural formations. The goal is to create a robust and accurate model that can automatically recognize and annotate landmarks in various types of images.
